					<p>It was hard, of course, and i got millions of errors that didn't even make sense! But i did not give up and that is why here is what i have!</p>

					<p>It was a great Experience. And i have to accept, hardwork does pay off!!</p>

					<h5>My Experience as a Developer</h5>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Reverse Engineering</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Google is just a reference.</p>
